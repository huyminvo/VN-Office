## Build third party dependencies

To build third-party dependencies you can use our build script at Common/3dParty/build_dependencies.sh. Currently it only supports a Nextcloud remote but feel free to add support for others as well. You have to add a NEXTCLOUD_USER, NEXTCLOUD_PASS, NEXTCLOUD_REMOTE and BASE_REMOTE_PATH. Then run 
```sh
./build_dependencies.sh
```

to build all dependencies. This takes very long (~5 hours or more). Once finished, the binary files are in `PKG_NAME/VERSION/TARGET_TRIPLET/PKG_NAME_binary.tar.bz2` of your specified remote. Once finished you can build the project with your pre-compiled binaries by specifying 
```sh
-DVCPKG_BINARY_REMOTE="https://my-remote.corp/repository/vcpkg/"
```
in the cmake command of the core or desktop build.
